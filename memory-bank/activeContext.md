# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- **CONFIRMED**: main_new.py is working properly with rangefinder integration
- Rangefinder architecture validated - proper abstraction through SMARS class
- System architecture analysis complete
- Web interface with real-time distance sensing operational

## Latest Changes
1. **Rangefinder Integration Analysis Complete**
   - Confirmed rangefinder.py is properly integrated via SMARS class abstraction
   - main_new.py uses rangefinder through robot.distance property
   - Architecture follows clean separation of concerns: rangefinder.py → smars.py → main_new.py
   - Real-time distance display working in web interface with auto-refresh every 500ms
   - User confirmed preference for current integration approach

2. Motor Control Interface Fix
   - Added explicit `method="get"` to all HTML forms
   - Created debug version (main_debug.py) with enhanced logging
   - Fixed missing motor controls issue in web interface
   - Added simplified interface option (/simple endpoint)

3. WiFi Connection Management
   - Added network scanning
   - Implemented signal strength monitoring
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added connection recovery
   - Improved timeout handling

4. Web Interface
   - Simplified code structure
   - Enhanced response handling
   - Improved error reporting
   - Touch-optimized controls
   - Cleaner HTML/CSS implementation

## Active Issues
1. **RESOLVED**: Rangefinder Integration Question
   - **CONFIRMED**: Current integration approach is optimal
   - rangefinder.py properly used as module through SMARS abstraction
   - main_new.py working correctly with distance sensing
   - Architecture maintains clean separation of concerns

2. Web Interface Motor Controls Missing
   - **FIXED**: Added explicit `method="get"` to all form elements
   - **FIXED**: Created debug version with enhanced logging
   - Root cause was likely missing method attribute in forms
   - Both main.py and main_debug.py now updated

3. Performance Optimization
   - Looking into sensor polling frequency
   - Investigating network latency
   - Battery efficiency improvements needed

4. Error Handling
   - Enhanced network error recovery
   - Improved connection stability
   - Better error reporting

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Fine-tune movement durations
   - Implement battery monitoring
   - Add connection quality indicator
   - Create configuration interface

2. Medium Term
   - Performance monitoring system
   - Advanced navigation patterns
   - Enhanced diagnostic tools
   - Network status visualization

## Testing Focus
1. Current Tests
   - Network reliability
   - Connection recovery
   - Error handling
   - Response times

2. Pending Tests
   - Long-term stability
   - Battery performance
   - System diagnostics
   - Advanced navigation

## Development Notes
- **main_new.py confirmed operational** with proper rangefinder integration
