# Project Brief: NewSMARS_pico

## Overview
NewSMARS_pico is a Python-based robotics control system designed for the SMARS robot platform, utilizing a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The project focuses on providing both autonomous and manual control capabilities for SMARS robots.

## Core Requirements
1. Autonomous Operation
   - Self-directed movement capabilities
   - Environmental awareness using rangefinder sensors
   - Obstacle detection and avoidance

2. Manual Control
   - Web-based control interface
   - WiFi connectivity for remote operation
   - Real-time control response

3. Sensor Integration
   - Range finding capabilities
   - Sensor data processing
   - Environmental mapping

4. System Architecture
   - Modular code structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Extensible design for future enhancements

## Project Goals
1. Create a reliable and responsive robot control system
2. Implement both autonomous and manual control modes
3. Ensure robust sensor integration
4. Maintain clean, well-documented code
5. Support easy deployment and configuration

## Success Criteria
- Successful autonomous navigation
- Reliable WiFi connectivity
- Accurate sensor readings and response
- Responsive web control interface
- Stable robot operation in both control modes

## Key Components
1. `main.py`: Core program entry point
2. `main_new.py`: **CONFIRMED WORKING** - Enhanced web control with real-time distance sensing
3. `autonomous.py`: Autonomous operation logic
4. `rangefinder.py`: **CONFIRMED WORKING** - Sensor integration via SMARS abstraction
5. `smars.py`: **CONFIRMED WORKING** - Base robot functionality with rangefinder integration
6. `webcontrol.py`: Web interface control
7. WiFi connectivity modules
8. Test suites for various components

## Confirmed Working Integration
- **Rangefinder Architecture**: `rangefinder.py` → `smars.py` → `main_new.py`
- **Real-time Distance Sensing**: Working in web interface with 500ms auto-refresh
- **Clean Modular Design**: User-validated architecture with proper separation of concerns
